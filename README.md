## Requirements
- https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/liquid-crystal-i2-c

## Parts
- arduino uno/nano
- 2 HC-SR501 PIR sensors
- resistros approx 330Î©
- LCD I2C with backlight
- power bank
- some box (in my case I used the one from a bicycle stem)

## How to build
If you check some "hello world" examples of how to work with PIR sensor and LCD I2C, source code will be self explanatory.
